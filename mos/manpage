merOS :: Build and Interact with a Set of Virtual Machines


DESCRIPTION


Families are used to describe Sets of Targets ( Virtualized Machines )

Configuration files are found, and should be placed,
under conf/families/[fam-id]/ - Containing:
	
1. The Target rootfs directory :: rootfs/[target-id]/includes.chroot/ 
   Where any custom package configuration file, or persistent data, can be placed.

2. The Target build-time hooks directory :: rootfs/[target-id]/hooks/ 
   Where a shell script can be placed and is run in the Target Chroot, before build.

3. Build XML configuration files :: build/[target-id].xml 
   Where Target properties are described, such as Distro, Image Free Size, etc.

4. Host run-Time hooks :: hooks/ 
   Where Host run-time hooks can be found- These are executed upon Family initialization.

5. Libvirt XML configuration files :: libvirt/[target-id].xml
   Describing Virtual Machine Emulation options.


BUILD && MANAGE A VM


vm-full-id = [fam-id] + [target-id] --  
(ex. mos_sec-guest)


Configurations files follow: [fam-id]/rootfs|build|libvirt/[target-id]/

--build [fam-id] :	This creates and populates the rootfs chroot dir,
			builds the qemu compatible .qcow image, which can be found under
			data/images/

--init [fam-id] :	Initialize Target VMs and Networks.

--shutdown	:	Currently halts *ALL* libvirt guests.

 
COMMUNICATING WITH A VM


The following are require an SSH server on the Target Side, 
along with an active network connection with the host (As found in mos_sec)


--connect [vm-full-id]		:	SSH into Targets' defined user ( *As found under /build/[target-id]* )

--run [vm-full-id] [executable] :	ex. mos_sec-guest run firefox

--push [vm-full-id] [file/ folder]	:	Copy file to Target ( *Defaults pastes to ~/.mos-shared/ )

--pull [vm-full-id]			:	Pull all files from Targets' ~/mos-shared/ 
						to data/mos-shared/[vm-full-id]
